In this course, learners will apply rigorous measurement and analysis techniques to common HR areas involving hiring top talent, evaluating workforce diversity, engaging the workforce, and managing retention. Through activities and assignments, learners will explore foundational frameworks that are relevant to analyses ranging from basic descriptions to more advanced predictive models that involve machine learning, artificial intelligence, or big data. As learners examine key inputs and data sources, they will use data to predict patterns and trends in areas such as diversity, engagement, and performance. Ultimately, students will use metrics and analytics to assess the current talent landscape of an organization and outline recommendations as they create a presentation for senior leadership. This course assumes a basic comfort level in working with HR data and analysis. It is designed to equip students with the concepts, tools, and language specific to key areas within HR analytics.
