The explosive growth of computer technology, globalisation, and theoretical advances in finance and mathematics have resulted in quantitative methods playing an increasingly important role in the financial services industry and the economy as a whole. New mathematical and computational methods have transformed the investment process and the financial industry. Today banks, investment firms, and insurance companies turn to technological innovation to gain competitive advantage. Sophisticated mathematical models are used to support investment decisions, to develop and price new securities and innovative products or to manage risk. Hence there is an increasing demand from the industry for graduates with a high level of quantitative and analytical skills.","The programme is conducted jointly by the Faculty of Science, NUS Business School and School of Computing. The curriculum is multidisciplinary with coverage in the following areas:
 1) Mathematical Theory and Tools. Students can look forward to reading modules such as MA1101R Linear Algebra I, MA1102R Calculus, MA1104 Multivariable Calculus, MA3252 Linear and Network Optimisation, and MA3264 Mathematical Modelling.

TGS-2015502813,Network Planning And Operations,Bachelor of Science (Statistics) (Hons),"Statistics is the scientific application of mathematical principles to the collection, analysis, and presentation of numerical data. Statisticians contribute to scientific inquiry by applying their mathematical and statistical knowledge to the design of surveys and experiments; the collection, processing, and analysis of data; and the interpretation of the results. Statisticians may apply their knowledge of statistical methods to a variety of subject areas, such as biology, business, economics, education, engineering, finance, marketing, medicine, psychology, public health, and sports. In particular, biostatistics is a specialisation of statistics for quantitative research in the health sciences. The designs and analytic methods of biostatistics enable health scientists and professionals in academia, government, pharmaceutical companies, medical research organisations and elsewhere to efficiently acquire knowledge and draw valid conclusions from their ever-expanding sources of information.

","Statistics is an interdisciplinary subject by nature. In the development of Statistics, Mathematics and Computer Science respectively provide the theoretical foundation and the computational tools while real-world problems stimulate and guide further research. These considerations are reflected in the Department's curriculum. In addition to Statistics modules, Statistics students are encouraged to read modules in Mathematics and Computer Science. Students can expect to read core modules such as ST1131 Introduction to Statistics, MA1101R Linear Algebra I, MA1102R Calculus, CS1010 Programming Methodology, ST2131/ MA2216 Probability, ST2132 Mathematical Statistics, ST2137 Computer Aided Data Analysis, and MA2311 Techniques in Advanced Calculus.
The core statistical education consists of probability and stochastic processes, statistical principles, computer-aided data analysis, regression analysis, and categorical data analysis. Modules include ST3131 Regression Analysis, ST3236 Stochastic Processes I, MA3229 Introduction to Geometric Modelling, MA3252 Linear and Network Optimisation, MA3256 Applied Cryptography, and MA3259 Mathematical Methods in Genomics.
Honours students majoring in Statistics have the option to specialise in Biostatistics or in Finance and Business Statistics. The department has particular strengths in survival analysis, epidemiology, clinical trials and longitudinal data analysis for Biostatistics, and in time series analysis, statistical methods for actuarial science and finance, and data mining for Finance and Business Statistics.

Each demonstration must be reviewed periodically to show that risks are controlled and reduced to an acceptable level according to applicable legislation and internal company governance requirements.

Risk evaluation can also help the decision-making process, in comparing the risks involved in alternative processes or layouts, and optimising expenditure to improve safety.

QRA helps to identify and evaluate possible accidental events, including their causes and consequences, and provides a basis for emergency preparedness and land use planning.
