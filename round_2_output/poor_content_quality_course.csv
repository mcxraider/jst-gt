Companies spend billions of dollars annually on business intelligence tools for the simple reason that it drives the top and bottom line. According to Gartner, business intelligence has been the number one technology for the past three years running and surveys have shown that it is the second most important application and technology issue after anti-virus protection.However, deriving insights from data analytics is NOT the domain of large companies. Even small companies (SMEs) and start-ups can benefit from it. Data Analytics is NOT just about IT solutions and tools; rather it is a methodology and process that is independent of IT. Insights from Data Analytics is NOT solely about amassing large amounts of information and data and applying technology to see trends and patterns; it is about knowing what to collect in a timely manner and that will feed into and add value to the decision-making process.Companies are focusing on business insights as the primary inputs into business strategy formulation, marketing and operations. The more business insights a company has about the customer, the competition and the market, the better will be the position it will be in to increase its revenues and profits. Companies that have good business insights will almost always perform better than others.",,Business and Organisational Management,Business Data Analysis,NANYANG TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY,SSG-NON-WSQ,N

","Point-of-Care Testing (POCT) is increasingly popular in the world and it is particularly useful when patients live a distance away from a hospital laboratory. Microfluidic Lab-on-a-Chip technologies offer three main advantages to POCT diagnostics: smaller sample volumes, lower test costs, and faster turn-around times. These advantages are increasingly being leveraged to develop POCT devices to detect and diagnose a host of conditions, spanning from infectious diseases to cancer. This course module is designed for and targeted at engineers or PMETs who have a degree or background knowledge of medical diagnostic products and interested in the knowledge and skills pertaining to product development of Point-of-Care Testing (POCT). Microfluidic Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) technologies have become the promising solutions that can meet the requirement of the POCT since they can miniaturize and integrate most of the functional modules used in central laboratories into a small cassette, or cartridge. We propose to cover the knowledge and skills about immune-sensing and optical detection, molecular diagnostics and cellular analysis in the application of miniaturized medical diagnostics, as well as the practical methods about developing new POCT products, which are mostly medical instrument and cartridges or cassettes. Knowledge and skills about building up the quality management system in medical product development will be covered as well.
